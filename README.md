## Etch-A-Sketch Challenge

This is my attempt at building an Etch-A-Sketch-like game in pure HTML/JS.

I used SASS to generate:

1. The greyscale classes that darken the grid with each hover.
2. The media queries that change the grid size based on the screen size, ensuring that the grid is always square.

The game is fully responsive and handles touch/hover events appropriately on both desktop and mobile.
